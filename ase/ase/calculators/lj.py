    The fundamental definition of this potential is a pairwise energy:

    ``u_ij = 4 epsilon ( sigma^12/r_ij^12 - sigma^6/r_ij^6 )``

    For convenience, we'll use d_ij to refer to "distance vector" and
    ``r_ij`` to refer to "scalar distance". So, with position vectors `r_i`:

    ``r_ij = | r_j - r_i | = | d_ij |``

    Therefore:

    ``d r_ij / d d_ij = + d_ij / r_ij``
    ``d r_ij / d d_i  = - d_ij / r_ij``

    The derivative of u_ij is:

    ::

        d u_ij / d r_ij
        = (-24 epsilon / r_ij) ( 2 sigma^12/r_ij^12 - sigma^6/r_ij^6 )

    We can define a "pairwise force"

    ``f_ij = d u_ij / d d_ij = d u_ij / d r_ij * d_ij / r_ij``

    The terms in front of d_ij are combined into a "general derivative".

    ``du_ij = (d u_ij / d d_ij) / r_ij``

    We do this for convenience: `du_ij` is purely scalar The pairwise force is:

    ``f_ij = du_ij * d_ij``

    The total force on an atom is:

    ``f_i = sum_(j != i) f_ij``

    There is some freedom of choice in assigning atomic energies, i.e.
    choosing a way to partition the total energy into atomic contributions.

    We choose a symmetric approach (`bothways=True` in the neighbor list):

    ``u_i = 1/2 sum_(j != i) u_ij``

    The total energy of a system of atoms is then:

    ``u = sum_i u_i = 1/2 sum_(i, j != i) u_ij``

    Differentiating `u` with respect to `r_i` yields the force, indepedent of the
    choice of partitioning.

    ::

        f_i = - d u / d r_i = - sum_ij d u_ij / d r_i
            = - sum_ij d u_ij / d r_ij * d r_ij / d r_i
            = sum_ij du_ij d_ij = sum_ij f_ij

    This justifies calling `f_ij` pairwise forces.

    The stress can be written as ( `(x)` denoting outer product):

    ``sigma = 1/2 sum_(i, j != i) f_ij (x) d_ij = sum_i sigma_i ,``
    with atomic contributions

    ``sigma_i  = 1/2 sum_(j != i) f_ij (x) d_ij``

    Another consideration is the cutoff. We have to ensure that the potential
    goes to zero smoothly as an atom moves across the cutoff threshold,
    otherwise the potential is not continuous. In cases where the cutoff is
    so large that u_ij is very small at the cutoff this is automatically
    ensured, but in general, `u_ij(rc) != 0`.

    This implementation offers two ways to deal with this:

    Either, we shift the pairwise energy

    ``u'_ij = u_ij - u_ij(rc)``

    which ensures that it is precisely zero at the cutoff. However, this means
    that the energy effectively depends on the cutoff, which might lead to
    unexpected results! If this option is chosen, the forces discontinuously
    jump to zero at the cutoff.

    An alternative is to modify the pairwise potential by multiplying
    it with a cutoff function that goes from 1 to 0 between an onset radius
    ro and the cutoff rc. If the function is chosen suitably, it can also
    smoothly push the forces down to zero, ensuring continuous forces as well.
    In order for this to work well, the onset radius has to be set suitably,
    typically around 2*sigma.

    In this case, we introduce a modified pairwise potential:

    ``u'_ij = fc * u_ij``

    The pairwise forces have to be modified accordingly:

    ``f'_ij = fc * f_ij + fc' * u_ij``

    Where `fc' = d fc / d d_ij`.

    This approach is taken from Jax-MD (https://github.com/google/jax-md), which in
    turn is inspired by HOOMD Blue (https://glotzerlab.engin.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/).

          True means that a smooth cutoff function is multiplied to the pairwise
          energy that smoothly goes to 0 between ro and rc. Both energy and
          forces are continuous in that case.
          If smooth=True, make sure to check the tail of the forces for kinks, ro
          might have to be adjusted to avoid distorting the potential too much.
