    """
    Check that the neighbor lists are updated properly when model parameters
    are updated. This is done by instantiating the calculator for a specific
    Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential, included with the KIM API, for Mo-Mo
    interactions.  First, an equally spaced collinear trimer is constructed
    whose separation distances are just over half the cutoff distance
    associated with Mo so that only nearest-neighbor interactions occur (the
    end atoms do not interact with one another) and the energy is computed.
    Next, the model's cutoff parameter associated with Mo is increased to a
    distance greater than the distance between the end atoms, so that their
    interaction will produce a (fairly small) non-zero value.  The energy is
    computed once again and it is verified that this energy differs
    significantly from the initial energy computed, thus implying that the
    neighbor lists of the end atoms must have been updated so as to contain one
    another.
