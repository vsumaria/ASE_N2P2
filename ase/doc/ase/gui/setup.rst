The setup menus allow for the intuitive creation of numerous standard
surfaces, nanoparticles, graphene and graphene nanoribbons, as well as

Along with creating the geometry within the GUI, a button provides the
necessary Python code allowing one to recreate the exact same geometry
in ASE scripts.
